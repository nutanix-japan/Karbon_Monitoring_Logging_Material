.. title:: Cleaning up your namespace and Grafana installation

------------------------
Cleanup and Takeaways
------------------------

Cleanup
++++++++

Cleanup port-forwarding for Prometheus and Grafana. Just **ctrl+c** the commands.

If you have sent these commands to background, you can bring them to foreground by using

.. code-block:: bash

 fg

Cleanup your namespace. This will also delete all the resources inside the namespace.

.. code-block:: bash

 # change to ntnx-system to be able to list deployed helm charts in that namespace

 k config set-context $(k config current-context) --namespace=ntnx-system

 helm list #copy your grafana chart name to use in the next uninstall command
 NAME              	  NAMESPACE  	  REVISION  APP VERSION
 grafana-1597884244	  ntnx-system	  1         7.1.1

 helm uninstall grafana-1597884244 #this chart name will vary in your implementation

.. note::

	**Do not** delete Prometheus implementation in **ntnx-system** namespace. Leave it as is.

Takeaways
++++++++++

We have been through implementation and use of kubernetes monitoring and logging in this bootcamp and we can't help but notice that
this process is quite simple.

- Prometheus is open-source metrics collector
- Nutanix Karbon deployed kubernetes has a default implementation of Prometheus to monitor the health of kubernetes nodes and appplications
- It is a good practice to deploy a separate instance of Prometheus to monitor user applications
- Grafana is a visualisation tool which we could deploy to visualise collected metrics
- Elastic Stack is open-source logging collector, analyser and visualisation framework
- Nutanix Karbon deployed kubernetes has a default implementation of Elastic Stack (Elastisearch and Kibana), and Fluent Bit for logs processing
- Kibana is the log visualisation tool of choice in the Elastic Stack
- Customers are able to deploy their own instance of Elastic Stack for their applications
- Kubernetes operators are a easy way of installing, upgrading, life-cycle managing a complex stateful application
