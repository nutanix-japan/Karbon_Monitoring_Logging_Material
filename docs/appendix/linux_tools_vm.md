           ```bash
           ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "Created for Linux Tools VM"
           
           # follow prompts 
           # do not specify passphrase
           # once completed run the following command
           
           cat id_rsa.pub
           
           # copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your cloudinit yaml file
           ```
        </details>

        - Paste the following script in the script window 
        
          ```yaml

          hostname: myhost
          
          # Create a new user
          users:
          - default
          - name: nutanix
              groups: users
              ssh_authorized_keys:
              # Paste the generated public key here
              - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQD...... 
              # You can also use the 1N or 6N format (openssl passwd -1 "yourplaintextpassword")
              passwd: $1$CW55TPkL$gzOS35bI6fdxtwntlE3CN/                             
          
          # Enable password authentication for root
          ssh_pwauth: True
          
          # Run additional commands
          runcmd:
          - 'sleep 10' # sleeping for the network to be UP
          - 'echo "nutanix ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers'
          
          # Run package upgrade
          package_upgrade: true
          
          # Install the following packages - add extra that you would need
