Helm
-------------------------------

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes based applications and resources deployment.

Helm also provides an easy way of accomplishing the following:

- Install and uninstall kubernetes applications
- Versioning complex kubernetes applications
- Upgrade and rollback kubernetes applications

You can think of Helm as ``yum`` or ``apt-get`` package managers in Linux.

Helm has the following main components (not limited to):

- Helm command line tool - provides interface to all Helm functionality
- Charts - charts are manifests (yaml) files for desired kubernetes resources
- Value file(s) - all customisable values for the application deployment can be configured here

.. note::

  Helm used to be a server-client application. Helm being the client and Tiller server component being installed in a kubernetes cluster. With Helm 3.x onwards, Tiller is removed and only Helm is used for ease.
